# The Cyborg Project (working title)

In this project I aim to build a one handed keyboard that interfaces with a custom-built smartwatch

This watch will have an always on terminal that lets me interface with my computer in a consistent way from anywhere very quickly

Eventually I hope to build number of impressive features that will enable me to do all sorts of crazy stuff on the fly.
